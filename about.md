# Paul David - Software Engineer

I'm an engineer with a background in writing secure, low-level software for both
endpoint protection and detection (EDR) platforms and high-speed communication systems.

My areas of expertise include:
* Secure software development and distributed applications.
* Reverse engineering software with various technology stacks.
* Bug hunting and exploitation.
* Development of communication systems for the Internet-of-Things (IoT)
  and satellite communications.
* Experience with solving digital signal processing (DSP) problems.
* FPGA tools, digital design, and verification for high-speed communication systems.

I have experience with a variety of tools and programming languages, such as
C, C++, Rust, and Python. I've also had exposure to web development and securing
the whole stack from the frontend to the backend. I have familiarity working
with low-latency and high bandwidth hardware platforms such as the Ettus USRP and
other software-defined radios (SDR) for the purpose of developing communication
systems and security research.

My professional (and hobby) interests include learning new programming languages,
reverse engineering, exploitation, and digital signal processing.

This webspace is intended to serve as a place to post articles and write-ups for
my projects and ideas. I'm always open to communication so feel free
