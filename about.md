I'm a research engineer with a background in software development,
high-speed communication systems, and cybersecurity.

My areas of expertise include:
* Secure software development and distributed applications.
* Development of communication systems for the Internet-of-Things (IoT)
  and satellite communications.
* Experience with solving digital signal processing (DSP) problems.
* FPGA tools, digital design, and verification for high-speed communication systems.
* Cybersecurity with a focus on safe coding practices, vulnerability research,
  reverse engineering, and more.

I have experience with a variety of tools and programming languages, such as
C, C++, and Python. My experience also includes languages such as JavaScript,
Lua, and other scripting languages. I have familiarity with low-latency and
high bandwidth hardware platforms such as the Ettus USRP and other 
software-defined radios (SDR), which have been utilized in my security research
as well.

My professional (and hobby) interests include learning new programming languages,
reverse engineering, signal processing, and visualizations.

This webspace is intended to serve as a place to post articles and write-ups for
my projects and ideas. I'm always open to communication so feel free
